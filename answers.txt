What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

The difference between a merge and a rebase is that a merge is combines the 
changes created between two difference branches and rebase creates a
new separate list of commits that are top of the original branch. For rebase,
changes made from other branches can be integrated within a target branch, but 
merge simply combines two separate branches.
